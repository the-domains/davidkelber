**_THE "WHO"_**

**__**

Every adventure has a starting point, this is mine. My name is David Kelber, I am 44 years old, and a proud husband and father. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/12362da6-a317-4c62-8406-13d2702b2937.jpg)

**_THE "WHAT"_**

I am embarking on this new journey out of necessity more than anything else. Let me explain. I find myself at a point that I never wanted or expected to be. Life has become vanilla, ordinary, uninspiring and The other side of this is that I am concerned for my health and longevity. For the first time in my life, I am noticing the wear and tear of almost a half century. There is noticeable gray in the sideburns and whiskers, and there is a undesirable and ever-increasing "spare tire" hanging off my frame.

A few days ago, I was sitting in a hospital waiting room for a few hours while my father-in-law had a heart catherization. That in itself is enough to make you pause and reflect upon your own state of health. But, over those hours, I witnessed countless numbers of patients, of all ages being walked and wheeled in front of me on their way to surgery prep. I was taken back at the reality of where I am and where I could very well end up if I do not take serious steps to circumvent the direction I'm heading in. Looking at me, it would appear that I am in relatively good health, but looks can be deceiving, and I know better than anyone the "real story" of how my health and level of physical fitness has declined over the past few years. I will be honest, it's my own fault. The reasons don't differ much from most, life gets in the way, working too many hours, then too exhausted and unmotivated to workout, poor diet, and ultimately a lack of discipline and smart choices. And it's systemic really, If I don't dedicate my time to a healthy lifestyle, my family follows suit, and so it goes. 

I am going to be completely honest in my approach and disclosure regarding where I am and where I am going. This is an experiment that I want to document for both myself, but for others who either find themselves in similar circumstances; or as a preventative for those looking ahead.

The purpose or the "what" of this blog is two fold. 

1) To test out a theory, and to document a personal case study of myself during this journey. The theory is as follows: Will moving to a no sugar diet while adding a solid exercise routine show marked improvements in my overall health (categories to be measured: weight, sleep, mental alertness/efficiency, energy, mood,) 

2) To serve as motivation for myself and others.

**THE "WHY"**

So why am I doing all of this? The simple answer is for longevity. I want to actually be around for my wife, my children, one day for grandchildren, and to do so in good health

**THE "HOW" **

Now that we have established the basics for this blog, the lingering question is "how" will I go about this experiment? That question is a bit more detailed, but requires a significant amount of attention to ensure it is accurate and recordable. 

**THE "NUMBERS"**

The proof is in the pudding as they say. In order to show accurate improvements or declines (hoping for only improvements here!) I have to start with definable and concrete numbers. In order to do this, I will be scheduling a full physical exam with my primary physician. I will ask for a full work up of my numbers, to include the following:
